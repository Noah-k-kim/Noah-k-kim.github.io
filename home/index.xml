      <description>Biography I have started my career path as a self-taught web developer, specializing with Symfony web framework. I have worked on projects of various scale, including online education platforms, 360Â° virtual tour guides, and fitness planners.
During this time I have made numerous contributions the open-source community, both directly to the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve relied upon, and releasing my own projects.
Eventually I have decided to pivot my career and take an active part in research and development of a field I am passionate about: artificial intelligence.</description>
