      <description>Biography I have started my career path as a self-taught web developer, specializing with Symfony web framework. I have worked on projects of various scale in many different domains such as finance, education and health. During this time I have actively participated in the open-source community, contributing to projects I used, and releasing my own projects for others to use.
Eventually I have decided to pivot my career and take an active part in research and development of a field I am very passionate about: artificial intelligence.</description>
